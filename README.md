# CinnamonRoleBot
UNF Esports Club Discord Bot
This is just a bot created by me, Ki-Jana Panzarella, for the UNF esports club discord. I'm making this without anyone's knowing and hopefully I can surprise everyone with a fully functioning bot very soon. I plan to keep this bot up and running whenever my computer is on (which is normally around 12 hours a day) and it should help prevent new members from having to wait for a mod or admin to notice them and grant them the roles they would like to be associated with in the discord.

So far this bot successfully assigns roles (when it's able to detect them in a message) but only if one role is requested at a time in its own message. This will soon be expanded to work for any number of roles being requested in any number of messages.
